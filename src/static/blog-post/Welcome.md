Hello, this is the first post on the blog. An example post. This website is built with Vite + Vue3 ðŸ™‚

Blog posts are Markdown files with the meta data and parsed content extracted at build time, which happens automatically with every push since this site is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/s7software/s7.gg).

Thanks for reading!
