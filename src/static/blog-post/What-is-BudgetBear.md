Managing personal finances can feel overwhelming, but having the right tools makes it much easier. That’s why we built **BudgetBear** — a simple yet powerful budgeting app designed to give you clear insights into your spending and help you stay on top of your money.  

Whether you’re saving for a big goal or just trying to cut down on unnecessary expenses, BudgetBear helps you build better habits without the stress.  

### Smarter Budget Tracking

BudgetBear makes it easy to stay in control of your money. Here are some of the key features:  

#### 1. Custom Budgets  
Set daily, weekly, or category-specific budgets to keep yourself accountable and avoid overspending.  

#### 2. Transaction Management  
Log your purchases manually or automate recurring expenses like rent, bills, or subscriptions.  

#### 3. Insights Dashboard  
Quickly see where your money goes with clean, visual breakdowns of your spending habits.  

#### 4. Custom Categories  
Personalize your finances with categories, icons, and colors that fit your lifestyle.  

#### 5. Flexible Settings  
Choose when your budgeting cycle resets (like payday) and filter data the way you want to see it.  

### Why BudgetBear?

I originally built a budgeting app years ago to help save for a house deposit. It worked so well that I decided to rebuild it from scratch — cleaner, faster, and packed with more features to help others achieve their financial goals.  

### Privacy First  

All your financial data is stored securely on your own device, with iCloud support to keep it synced across your Apple devices. Your information stays private — always.  

### Conclusion  

BudgetBear isn’t just another expense tracker. It’s a tool built to help you understand your spending, save smarter, and reach your goals faster.
