Meal planning can feel like a chore, but having the right system makes it simple. That’s why we built **MyMenu** — a straightforward meal planning app designed to help you organize your weekly meals and automatically generate the shopping list you need.  

Whether you’re cooking for yourself, your partner, or your family, MyMenu helps you save time, reduce stress, and shop smarter.  

### Smarter Meal Planning  

MyMenu makes it easy to stay in control of your weekly meals. Here are some of the key features:  

#### 1. Custom Meal Slots  
Define the meals that matter to you — Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, or just the ones you want to plan for.  

#### 2. Add Your Own Meals  
Create your go-to dishes like “Chilli and Rice” and attach the ingredients you’ll need.  

#### 3. Weekly Menu Generator  
Press a button and let MyMenu build you a weekly meal plan based on your saved meals.  

#### 4. Automatic Shopping List  
Every ingredient from your plan is collected into one shopping list, so you know exactly what to buy.  

#### 5. Simple and Flexible  
Keep it minimal or expand as you go — MyMenu adapts to your household’s needs.  

#### 6. Generate Meal Plans in Seconds
Use MyMenu's smart menu generator to quickly generate a meal plan for your week, with custom rules, and no duplicate meals (unless you want them!).

### Why MyMenu?  

The idea for MyMenu came from wanting to simplify weekly food planning. Instead of scribbling meal ideas on scraps of paper or forgetting key ingredients at the store, I wanted a way to bring everything together in one place — fast, simple, and reliable.  

### Privacy First  

All your data is stored securely on your device, with iCloud support to keep your menus and shopping lists synced across your Apple devices. Your information stays private — always.  

### Conclusion  

MyMenu isn’t just another recipe app. It’s a tool built to help you plan faster, shop smarter, and make weekly meals less stressful.  

MyMenu is coming soon to the iOS App Store.
