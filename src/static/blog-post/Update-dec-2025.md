A refreshed design has just been rolled out for the S7 website, making it easier to discover what we're building and get the apps you need.

### What's New

The biggest change is the **product pages**. Each app now has dedicated space to showcase what makes it special — complete with feature breakdowns, platform availability, and direct download links.

Previously, the site gave you a quick overview of our apps, but if you wanted details, you had to hunt for them. Now everything's right there.

### The Apps We're Building

Here's what's currently available or coming soon:

#### BudgetBear - Finance Tracker
A free budgeting app to help you manage your money. Track expenses, set budgets, and get insights into your spending habits. With features like **expense tracking**, **budget planning**, **financial reports**, and **iCloud sync**, it's built to help you stay on top of your finances without the stress.

**Available now** on iOS and Mac.

#### MyMenu - Meal Planner
Plan your weekly meals, generate shopping lists automatically, and reduce food waste. MyMenu includes **weekly meal planning**, **automated shopping lists**, **meal suggestions**, and the ability to save your **favourite meals** for quick access.

**Coming soon** to iOS and Mac.

#### TodayOS - Productivity Suite
An all-in-one productivity app that adapts to your workflow. Schedule, track, organize, and achieve more with **smart scheduling**, a **reflective journal**, **habit tracking**, **task management**, **visual kanban boards**, **notes**, and customizable **spaces** to organize projects.

**Coming soon** to Mac and Web. You can check out the early version at [todayos.co](https://todayos.co/).

#### Whirlwind - TailwindCSS Prototyping
Tailwind Play as a native desktop app, with **offline support**, **project management**, and **local saving**. Perfect for rapid prototyping without needing an internet connection.

**Coming soon** to Mac.

We're continuing to build out these apps and improve the site as we go. If you want to stay updated on new releases, follow along here on the blog or reach out via [email](mailto:josh@s7.gg) or [Twitter](https://x.com/joshbarkeruk).
